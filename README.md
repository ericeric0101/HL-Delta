## Configuration

The bot uses a combination of configuration files and environment variables:

### 1. **Configuration File** (config.json) - Primary Configuration

The preferred way to configure the bot is through the `config.json` file, which controls most of the bot's behavior:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "debug": false,
    "tracked_coins": ["BTC", "ETH", "HYPE", "USDC"],
    "autostart": true
  },
  "allocation": {
    "spot_pct": 70,
    "perp_pct": 30,
    "rebalance_threshold": 0.05
  },
  "trading": {
    "refresh_interval_sec": 60
  },
  "api": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8080,
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Configuration sections:
- **General settings:**
  - `debug`: Enable detailed debug logging
  - `tracked_coins`: List of coins to track and trade
  - `autostart`: Whether to start trading automatically
- **Allocation settings:**
  - `spot_pct`: Percentage of capital to allocate to spot positions (e.g., 70%)
  - `perp_pct`: Percentage of capital to allocate to perpetual positions (e.g., 30%)
  - `rebalance_threshold`: Threshold for rebalancing positions (e.g., 0.05 = 5%)
- **Trading settings:**
  - `refresh_interval_sec`: Interval for refreshing positions in seconds
- **API settings:**
  - `host`: Host for the API server
  - `port`: Port for the API server
  - `enabled`: Whether the API server is enabled

### 2. **Environment Variables** - Required for Authentication

These environment variables are used for authentication with HyperLiquid and must be set:

- `HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private key for trading on HyperLiquid
- `HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum address for HyperLiquid

Example using environment variables:
```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY={PRIVATE_KEY}
export HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS={SUB_ACCOUNT_TRADING_ADDRESS}
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables for authentication
3. Customize `config.json` to match your desired trading parameters
4. Run the example script to test your configuration:
```bash
python example.py
```
- The system checks the `autostart` setting in `config.json`. If set to `true` (the default), the bot will automatically start trading.

## Once started, the system enters the main monitoring loop:
- **Periodic checks:** Every 60 seconds (configurable), the bot checks for opportunities.
- **Funding Rate Monitoring:** At the 50th minute of each hour, it monitors funding rates.
- **Automatic Order Condition:** When an opportunity with an annualized yield of ≥ 5% is found, it automatically creates a delta-neutral position.

## The system automatically performs the following actions:
- **Position Creation:** Simultaneously buys spot and shorts perpetual contracts.
- **Position Switching:** If the current position's yield drops below 5% and a better opportunity is available, it closes the old position and opens a new one.
- **Order Tracking:** Automatically monitors order execution status.

**Note 1:** If you prefer manual control, set `autostart` to `false` in `config.json`. You can then start and stop the bot using API endpoints.

**Note 2:** When `autostart` is `false`, the backend service and API server will run, but the bot's core trading logic will remain in a "standby" state. The log message `Call start() manually to begin.` indicates that you need to trigger the bot via the API.

   1. Start the backend service: `python entrypoint.py`.
   2. Start the frontend service: `cd frontend && npm start`.
   3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
   4. In the "Account Overview" section on the dashboard, click the green "Start" button.

Clicking "Start" sends a `POST` request to the `/api/bot/start` endpoint, which calls the `start()` function and activates the bot's trading logic.

5. Start the bot:
```bash
python Delta.py
```

## Building

Build the Docker image with:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will create two images:
- `hypervault-tradingbot:delta` (latest version)
- `hypervault-tradingbot:delta-1.0.0` (versioned tag)

## API Endpoints

The bot provides a RESTful API for remote control and monitoring:

### Bot Control
- `GET /api/bot/state`: Get the current state of the bot
- `POST /api/bot/start`: Start the bot's trading operations
- `POST /api/bot/stop`: Stop the bot's trading operations
- `POST /api/bot/close-position/{coin}`: Close a specific position
- `POST /api/bot/create-position/{coin}`: Create a position for a specific coin

### Status and Monitoring
- `GET /api/status`: Get the current status of the bot and its positions
- `GET /api/status/funding-rates`: Get the current funding rates for all tracked coins
- `GET /api/status/positions`: Get all current positions

### Configuration
- `GET /api/config`: Get the current configuration of the bot
- `POST /api/config/update`: Update the bot's configuration
- `GET /api/config/tracked-coins`: Get the list of tracked coins
- `POST /api/config/add-coin/{coin}`: Add a coin to the tracked coins list
- `POST /api/config/remove-coin/{coin}`: Remove a coin from the tracked coins list

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` with your credentials
2. Adjust `config.json` to match your desired trading parameters
3. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name delta-bot \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file .env \
  hypervault-tradingbot:delta-1.0.0
```

## Frontend UI for Bot Monitoring

This project includes a frontend UI to help you track the bot's performance more easily.

- First, open a new terminal and run `python entrypoint.py` to start the backend (must be running on `localhost:8080`).
- Next, open another terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run `npm start` (the URL is typically `http://localhost:3000`).
